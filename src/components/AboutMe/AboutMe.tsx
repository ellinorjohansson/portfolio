        <p>
          I've always been driven by a curiosity for how digital content can
          capture attention, engage emotions, and influence people. With a
          degree in Digital Communication, I've learned how to tell stories,
          build brands, and create meaningful experiences.

          But the more I explored the digital world, the more I was drawn to the
          technical side, the part that brings ideas to life. Now, I'm building
          on that foundation as a Frontend Developer. I love crafting clean,
          user-friendly web solutions where design meets functionality. I'm
          currently diving deeper into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and React,
          and I'm always curious about new ways to build interactive and smart
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          To me, frontend development is about blending creativity with
          technology to create digital experiences that donâ€™t just work but feel
          right
